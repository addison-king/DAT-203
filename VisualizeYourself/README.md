# Visualize Yourself Project

## Abstract


##  Assigned Project Goals
1.  Engage in a full-lifecycle data project (from planning through analysis and sharing) with highly relevant data: data about yourself!
2.  Create visualizations of data which facilitate discovery of trends that would otherwise be obscured by the quantity or type of data gathered
3.  Reflect on an aspect of your life that you might wish to change or adjust somehow and create a customized tool for exploring such changes

##  Primary Question
Does auditory stimulus affect the speed of which I solve the rubik's cube? 

##  Initial Planning
* Daily, solve the cube 25 times
* Each day use different auditory stimulation (cycle through each type)
* Three types of audio:
    * White noise (or only ear plugs)
    * Mozart (or general classical music)
    * Metalcore (high BPM core music)
  
## Factor Model
 In order to account for variables in the experimental design, a "factor model" was created. This chart illustrates 4 different independent variables and 4 ways of controlling for them.

##  Peer Evaluation (Revision)
After presenting to a group of peers, some changes were made to the overall project. Audio stimulus was expanded to include a TV Show, an audiobook, and a disliked genre of music (Country).
The population sizes for these 3 categories are smaller than the original 3 due to time constraints.
