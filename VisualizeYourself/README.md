# Visualize Yourself Project

Assigned Project Goals:
1.  Engage in a full-lifecycle data project (from planning through analysis and sharing) with highly relevant data: data about yourself!
2.  Create visualizations of data which facilitate discovery of trends that would otherwise be obscured by the quantity or type of data gathered
3.  Reflect on an aspect of your life that you might wish to change or adjust somehow and create a customized tool for exploring such changes

#Initial Planning
* Daily, solve the cube 25 times
* Each day use different auditory stimulation (cycle through each type)
* Three types of audio:
    * White noise (or only ear plugs)
    * Mozart (or general classical music)
    * Metalcore (high BPM core music)
